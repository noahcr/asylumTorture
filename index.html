<h1>The Wait: How Tortured Asylum Seekers Suffer Through Years-long Waits to Stay in the U.S.</h1>

	</p>The process to apply for asylum in the United States is arduous: move, file and wait.</p> 

	<p>The whole process is supposed to take just 180 days, depending on when someone files their first piece of paperwork with the Department of Justice. But due to the overwhelming number of immigrants fleeing their countries, and a federal backlog of cases, the process has become expensive and can now take up to five years.</p>  

	<p>For those who are escaping their countries after being tortured—either by the government or by cultural figureheads—the multiple-year wait time can be devastating, especially since there is no guarantee their application will be approved. They are seeking protection under the U.N. Convention Against Torture, to which the U.S. is a signatory, but the U.S. has no separate process for these victims. They are thrown into the larger, backlogged pool of all asylum seekers.</p>
 
	<p>The critical stage of the asylum process is the asylum interview. The interview is scheduled at one of only eight locations around the country with an assigned asylum officer. The officer evaluates your identity, the story you’re presenting, and evidence you have in support of your claim—if you can produce any. And this is the stage, scheduling interviews, where the backlog occurs.</p>  
 
	<p>“This isn’t because the asylum officers or the immigration judges aren’t working hard, they’re working super hard, but they’ve got so many cases and they’re understaffed and they’re under-resourced and congress hasn’t funded more employees, ” says Maryellen Fullerton, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School.</p>
 
	<p>Fullerton says the backlog is a problem for both the asylum seekers, whose lives end up in limbo, and for the government, which can’t deport asylum seekers who don’t meet the requirements until a decision has been made.</p>

<p id="calculatorIntro">The waiting period for asylum seekers to get an interview varies massively depending on where they happen to be living - and the office could end up being hundreds of miles away. How long would you have to wait? And how far would you have to go?</p>

	<p>But while securing an interview is important, actually making a credible case for yourself in your interview is what’s critical for asylum seekers. The case presented in the interview determines whether or not that 2 - 5 year wait will result in a future in the U.S. or deportation.</p>
 
	<p>Asylum seekers are alleging that they are technically refugees, and are entitled to the same rights as refugees. But, in order to gain these rights they first need to prove they have a well founded fear of persecution. For torture victims, they must prove that it is “more likely than not” that they will be tortured again if deported. The interview is the chance to state their case for why they have this fear, and leading up to the interview is when they need to assemble all the pieces.</p>
 
	<p>“Gathering evidence from a far away place in a different culture and a different legal system is always hard, and even harder in these circumstances because the opportunity to leave has come in a hurry,” says Fullerton. “When they see opportunity they have to move quickly and it’s hard to have documentary evidence of those kinds of horrible deeds. Whoever does them, governments or other people, tend not to leave written records of them. So it’s hard to get access to that information and present it and to make sure if you do have it you’re able to preserve it throughout your journey,” she said.</p>
 
	<p>To overcome this challenge of obtaining evidence, Physicians for Human Rights, a network of over 500 clinicians across the country, provides physical and psychological evaluations of asylum seekers to back up their testimony.</p>
 
	<p>“The burden is on that individual to show that they meet the requirements, that they meet the legal standard,” says Meredith Fortin, asylum program officer at Physicians for Human Rights. While it’s legally possible for an applicant to demonstrate their eligibility through their own testimony alone, supporting evidence is often critical.</p>
 
	<p>During a medical evaluation a clinician will try to determine how any evidence, such as scars, on a person’s body maps onto their story of how the scar was received. According to Fortin, the psychological evaluation can also be very helpful in determining how trauma impacts an asylum seeker’s ability to report their experience.</p>
 
	<p>“Trauma can impact memory, that’s very common, and that could be the type of thing that can be very challenging in court. If the evaluator feels based on their opinion and their evaluation—which often lasts several hours with the individual—some of what’s happening is memory problems related to the trauma, that can be very important to the fact-finder to know. It’s another piece of information for them to take in when they’re considering the entire picture of an individual’s testimony and credibility and story, and how well it’s corroborated by the evidence,” said Fortin.</p>
